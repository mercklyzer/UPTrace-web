                        <ul>
                            <li>Phone number - to prevent fraud through a one-time PIN sent through SMS, and so that a user can be contacted if needed for contact tracing</li>
                            <li>Password (encrypted) - to secure your account</li>
                            <li>Email address (only for Health Liaison Officers [HeLOs] and UP Health Service [UPHS] Contact Tracers) - to identify a HeLO or a UPHS Contact Tracer and give them additional privileges in the application</li>
                            <li>Preferred contact time - to inform UPHS Contact Tracers of the start time and end time that you prefer to be contacted for monitoring and contact tracing </li>
                            <li>Preferred way of interview - to inform UPHS Contact Tracers of the way you prefer to be asked questions or to be interviewed for monitoring and contact tracing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Information about QR code scans are also collected, and this includes the user who scanned, the building and room visited, and the date and time of visit.</p>

                            <li>When signing up in UPTrace, we collect information enumerated in the “What information we collect”.</li>
                            <li>After successfully signing up, you may now scan QR codes in every entrance and exit points of establishments, as well as in every room you enter there. We save your scan logs in a server and these may be used for contact tracing purposes if necessary.

These information will then be disclosed to UPHS contact tracers so that they may assist you and perform contact tracing.</li>
                        </ol>
